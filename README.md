## Description

It should be run alongside ['my-demo-app'](https://github.com/ben3101/my-demo-app) and is used to create Verifiable Presentations. For demonstration purposes, entities for the user and issuer in the protocol have been hardcoded.

   `npm i`
2. Run the app with:
   `node user.js`
3. Once loaded, the app will listen on http://localhost:8081

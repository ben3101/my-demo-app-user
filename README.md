## Description

This application provides an interface for interacting with a [modified version](https://github.com/ben3101/CommunitySolidServer) of the Community Solid Server using a VC-based protocol. It should be run alongside ['my-demo-app'](https://github.com/ben3101/my-demo-app). For demonstration purposes, entities for the user and issuer in the protocol have been hardcoded.

## Starting the app

1. Install dependencies with the command:
   `npm i`
2. Run the app with:
   `node user.js`
3. Once loaded, the app will listen on http://localhost:8081
